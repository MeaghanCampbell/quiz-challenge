# User Story
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

# Acceptance Criteria

Create a quiz with a series of questions, letting the user know if they are right or wrong.
If they are wrong, 5 seconds should be subtracted from the clock. When the game is over, their
score should be the time remaining. They can save their initials to local storage, so when they
click view high scores at the end of the game, they can see their score.
